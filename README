Festival::Client


This is a really simple module for sending text to a Festival
speech synthesizer.

Festival is a free speech synthesizer for unixen from the University
of Edinburgh, see the Festival homepage at:
   http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/~awb/festival/


Note that this module uses the synth itself to say the text - it
doesn't return the waveform to you.  That capability may be added in
the future if people want it.


Contacting me:  gossamer@tertius.net.au is best.
